## Who am I?

I am Berlin, a software developer living in [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai).

I grew up in Hubei, China. My Chinese name is 吴连雯/吳連雯. Berlin is my english name, I know it is a name for the capital of germany, I still use it because I really really prefer "berlin" in Money Heist.

You can find me in [Github](https://github.com/childrentime) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wulianwen1).

## My work

I currently work on [Shopee](https://shopee.com/) as a front-end junior engineer.

## What I do when I am not working

- Watching TV: Friends, Money Heist, Sex Eduction and so on. I am a faithful user of Netflix.
- Sports: I run 5K or go to the gym sometimes.
- Reading: Reading is an essential part of my life. I'm reading Pride and Prejudice recently😄.
