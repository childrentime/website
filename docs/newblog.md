## The issue

Take this class for an example:

```ts
class A {
  #a = 0;
  func() { }
  b = this.#a;
}
```

When evaluating the class, V8 would collect the class field initializers (`#a = 0` and `b = this.#a`) and generate a synthetic instance member function, with the initializers as the function body. This function is there to simplify the handling of potential scope mismatches. Take this class for an example:
