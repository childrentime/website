This saturday was a little unusual. I watched TV shows and didn't stop until 1:30am. I had never been this late before. On the one hand, I can't resist the desire to keep watching. On the other hand, a roommate is still playing computer games. I had this kind of escape mentality: If he keeps playing games, I can't be able to fall asleep basically. Why don't I just keep watching? However, not all twenty-year-olds are full of energy, the bouts of drowsiness made me overwhelmed. I surrendered and rolled into bed.
